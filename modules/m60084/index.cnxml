  <md:title>Business and Moral Leaders</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This module is based on the hypothesis that moral exemplars make good--even excellent--leaders.  It is a derived copy of a module published previously on moral exemplars.  This module explored this topic as a gateway to virtue ethics and as an alternative to the big-news / bad news approach to business ethics.  This derived copy adds three layers of content: (1) a brief discussion of business leadership taken from Petrick and Quinn's outstanding book, Management Ethics: Integrity at Work.  Next, it adds a discussion of two historical figures, Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell.  More was portrayed as a moral exemplar in Robert Bolt's play and the movie, A Man for All Seasons while Cromwell was his Machiavellian opponent.  Recently, Hilary Mantel has reversed Bolt's assessment in her two books, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.  Mantel's More is a religious fanatic while Cromwell, the central character in these novels, is presented as a humanitarian political administrator.  An exercise based on these portrayals will provide an opportunity to examine whether there are multiple models or paradigms of moral exemplars.  Finally, an attempt has been made to update and expand the list of moral exemplars available for study.  Carmen Segarra (portrayed in This American Life), Sallie Krawcheck (profiled in the PBS Online News Hour), and Vandana Shiva (also portrayed in the News Hour) provide an interesting array of moral exemplar candidates for the modern scene.  These layers built upon the core module on moral exemplars provide a resource ideal for integration into introductory business courses. Consistent with the past, this module originated as a part of an NSF-funded project, "Collaborative Development of Ethics Across the Curriculum Resources and Sharing of Best Practices," NSF SES 0551779.  It is also being deployed in the context of two more recent grants, GREAT IDEA (NSF/EESE 1033028) and Cultivating Responsible Well-Being in STEM (NSF SES 1449489)</md:abstract>

<section id="eip-433"><title>Business Leadership</title><para id="eip-832">First, consider an argument that is frequently made.  Hitler was a bad--in fact a horrible--person.  But he was a good leader.  Even though he led in the wrong direction, toward the wrong goals, for the wrong reasons, he led effectively.  He got things done.  In other words, he was adept at devising effective and efficient means toward already determined ends.</para><para id="eip-607">The starting (and finishing) point of this module is that a business leader--or any other leader--cannot be a good leader without, at the same time, being a moral or ethical leader.  To illustrate this point, we will look at the analysis of leadership given by Joseph A Petrick and John F. Quinn in their book, <emphasis> Management Ethics: Integrity at Work </emphasis> (Sage,1997: 210-214).   </para><para id="eip-837">Petrick and Quinn provide the following definition of leadership: "<emphasis>Leading is the intended, coordinated, emergent and realized pattern of decision processes and actions that induce or influence the character and conduct of organizational members in appropriate directions by using appropriate resources.</emphasis>" (210) They proceed to unpack this definition by means of a series of useful lists (212).
</para><list id="eip-67"><title>"Culpably negligent leading"</title><item>"absence of explicitly intended leadership vision"</item>
<item>"inefficiently coordinated leadership style matches"</item>
<item>"leading that is rigidly unresponsive to emergent contingencies"</item>
<item>"inadequately realized leadership opportunities"</item>
<item>"unintegrated patterns of leadership processes and actions"</item>
<item>"leading that misdirects core business processes"</item>
<item>"leadership that persists in disrespecting people"</item>
<item>Consider some of the key words in this list as well as their opposites: vision, inefficiency (efficiency), unresponsiveness (responsiveness), unintegrated (integrated), misdirection (direction), and disrespecting (respecting).  This negative list implies a positive list that includes values and virtues.  Good leadership here is morally good leadership because it includes vision, integrity (integrating "<emphasis>processes and actions</emphasis>")responsiveness (and taking responsibility), and respect, especially respect for owners, customers, and employees.</item></list><para id="eip-846">The table just below compares a list of leadership traits identified by Petrick and Quinn with a list of engineering ethical virtues identified by Pritchard and Jaska.  There are many values in common such as creativity, cooperativeness, persistence, and integrity.  One important discrepancy: while the engineering list includes "willingness to sacrifice self-interest" there is no reference to this in the business list.  (In fact, much of the research in business in academia assumes that humans necessarily act on the basis of self-interest; their actions can be predicted on the basis of assuming that they are rational self-interest maximizers.)  There are also differences in emphasis; compare ambition to "not being too ambitious" and think about the subtle difference expressed here.  (See Pritchard, M. (1998). “Professional Responsibility: Focusing on the Exemplary.” Science and Engineering Ethics, Volume 4, Issue 2: 215-233.)</para><table id="eip-362" summary="Table on Positive Leadership Traits from Petrick and Quinn 212."><title>List 2: Positive Leadership Traits</title>

</tgroup><caption>Petrick and Quinn (212) set forth a list of positive leadership traits.  These are compared to engineering ethics virtues that have been identified by Pritchard and Jaska.</caption>
</table><para id="eip-581">Pritchard and Jaska’s list came about when they asked morally exemplary engineers to list the traits they would look for were they conducting a job search for hiring engineers for newly opening positions. (A certain degree of modesty or humility prevented those engineers interviewed from attributing these traits to themselves.)  Now, think about the following questions.  What traits do business leaders and morally exemplary engineers have in common?  What traits lay out their differences?  Why would engineers and business leaders have certain traits in common?  What new skills do engineers have to learn in order to become successful business managers?</para><para id="eip-588"><title>Skills sought for good business leadership</title>Pertick and Quinn go on to identify different bypes of leaders based on skill sets.  There are four groupings or sets of skills listed on page 213 of their text.</para><list id="eip-713"><item><emphasis>Technical Skills</emphasis>.  These include skills in quantitative and qualitative methods.  Rakesh Khurana in his book, From Higher Aims to Hired Hands, points out that much of business research is divided between methods and principles taken from sociology and those taken from economics.  One important import from economics is what has been termed by many as "homo economicus," the view described above that human beings are rational self-interest maximizers and, therefore, incapable of altruistic actions or motives.</item>

<item><emphasis>Interpersonal skills</emphasis>.  Quinn and Petrick are quite interesting here.  Their list includes “emotional expressivity, sensitivity and control, social expressivity, political sensitivity, control and manipulation, affective communication, and persuasiveness.” These strong social skills would not be as important for engineers and other professionals but are essential for business leaders, especially managers.  Consider some of the interpersonal skills deployed using the ethics tests we have studied this semester.  This would include role-talking and empathy deployed in the <emphasis>reversibility</emphasis> test, imaginative projection of experience as deployed by the <emphasis>harm</emphasis> test, and the ability to imagine and project a moral exemplar into a concrete situation, a skill deployed in the <emphasis>publicity</emphasis> test.</item>

<item><emphasis>Conceptual skills</emphasis>.  These include “anticipation of changing trends and opportunities, diagnostic analysis of problems, integrative prognosis of ongoing improvement and/or problem resolution, proficiency in conceptualization of complex and ambiguous relationships, creativity in idea generation and articulation, and sound logical reasoning.”  This seems to overlap considerably with the problem-solving framework that we have studied this semester: problem specification, solution generation, soluting testing, and solution implementation.</item>

<item><emphasis>Administrative skills</emphasis> include “effective work organization, prioritized operational obligations, efficient and timely in-basket processing of information, rapid routine decision making, constant monitoring of performance, solid control of financial resources, and sharp attention to detail.”
 Assigning work tasks, for example, would draw heavily from non-linear, systems thinking.  One would have to integrate such variables as areas of expertise, ability to get along with other members of the team, current and previous work assignments, expertise and how this expertise complements the backgrounds of the other members of the team.</item>
</list></section><section id="eip-389"><title>Argument that Business Leadership is built on Moral Leadership</title><list id="eip-655"><title>Argument that a bad human cannot be a good leader</title><item><emphasis>Premise 1</emphasis>.  To argue that a bad person can be a good leader is to relegate leadership to effectiveness, i.e., a good leader is someone who gets things done, no matter what.</item>

<item><emphasis>Premise 2</emphasis>: But this separates means from ends and reduces leadership to devising means to predetermined or pre-established ends.</item>

<item><emphasis>Conclusion 1</emphasis>: But this contradicts the lists presented above that leaders have vision, inspire others, and take responsibility for their actions.  It also contradicts the idea that leaders envision ends as well as devise means.</item>

<item><emphasis>Conclusion 2</emphasis>: If an argument leads to a contradictory conclusion, then it must be rejected and its contradictory affirmed in its place.  Hence, business leaders not only are efficient but they are also morally good.</item></list><section id="eip-803"><title>Separating Good Moral Characteristics from Good Leadership Characteristics</title><para id="eip-636">Now consider the following table.  Colby and Damon in <emphasis>Some Do Care</emphasis> outline what they used as moral exemplar criteria for their identification and interview of the moral exemplars that are profiled in their book.  They provide two lists, a longer preliminary list and a shorter, more refined list.  The unrefined list is more suggestive even though it is a bit ambiguous.  What do these moral exemplar criteria have to say about leadership in business?  Again, do they suggest that good moral qualities can be separated absolutely from good leadership qualities?

    <entry><emphasis>Comments on a possible redescription as business leader criteria</emphasis></entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>"A sustained commitment to definable moral principles."</entry>
    <entry>Business leaders could add to moral principles organizational values (vision, mission, values) and a commitment to general business disciplinary values like open competition, fair play, and orientation toward common good.  A difficulty arises when moral principles come into conflict with an organization’s self-defined interests.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A consistent tendency to act in accordance with these principles.</entry>
    <entry>This argues that commitments are carefully and thoroughly integrated into the core self-system.  For example, one exercises the moral value of loyalty toward one’s company and the overall practice of business.  But this loyalty is not automatically moral because it is (or may be) uncritical.  This breaks down when there is a conflict between business and moral values.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A willingness to affirm (rather than deny or misrepresent) one’s acts, and to overtly express the principles that constitute one’s moral rational for such acts.</entry>
    <entry>This is a strong link between moral exemplars and business leaders.  Several leadership lists discuss the importance for being responsive, accepting ownership or responsibility for one’s acts, and acting out of respect for others, especially owners, coworkers, employees, and customers.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A willingness to risk personal well-being for the sake of one’s moral principles.</entry>
    <entry>This raises issues debated between agency theorists and stewardship, stakeholder, and alliance theorists.  Economic theory denies the predictability of actions other than those based on self-interest.  But this is debated and rejected by economists such as Akerlof and Shiller (Animal Spirits) and Sen (Rational Fools).</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A capacity for crafting and projecting a moral vision including particularly the ability to generate innovative solutions to moral problems.</entry>
    <entry>This module offers considerable evidence in the form of profiles that business leaders who are also moral exemplars can inspire and lead by projecting a moral as well as a business vision.  See Krawcheck, Yunus, Segarra, and Fuerstein.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A talent for inspiring others to moral action(7,1)</entry>
    <entry>Business leaders are certainly helped when they have the capability of motivating and inspiring; and this capability is inseparable from being exercised in a moral direction.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>A dedicated responsiveness to the lives of others.</entry>
    <entry>An example of a culpably negligent business leadership activity is lack of responsiveness. </entry>

<title>Introduction to Moral Exemplars</title><para id="element-960"> Through the activities of this module you will learn to balance cautionary tales in business and professional ethics with new stories about those who consistently act in a morally exemplary way.  While cautionary tales teach us what to avoid, narratives from the lives of moral exemplars show us how to be good.  A study of moral best practices in business and professional ethics shows that moral exemplars exhibit positive and learnable skills.  This module, then, looks at moral exemplars in business and the professions, outlines their outstanding accomplishments, and helps you to unpack the strategies they use to overcome obstacles to doing good.</para><para id="element-509">You will begin by identifying outstanding individuals in business and associated practices who have developed moral "best practices."

<item>Often moral exemplars perform actions that go beyond what is minimal, required, ordinary, or even extra-ordinary.</item>
<item>Moral exemplars perform actions that are "above and beyond the call of duty."</item>
<item>Most important, they perform these actions repeatedly across a career or even a lifetime.  In some way, their exemplary conduct has become "second nature."</item></list><list id="eip-254"><title>Supererogatory</title><item><emphasis>"A supererogatory act is an act that is beyond the call of duty. It is something that is morally good to do but not obligatory. Examples of supererogatory acts are donating blood, volunteering on a rape crisis hotline, babysitting (without accepting recompense) a friend’s two-year old triplets for the afternoon, or throwing oneself on a live hand grenade in order to save one’s buddies’ lives."</emphasis> (Baron, 1997: 614)</item>
<item>Baron's definition (found in the Encyclopedia of Business Ethics) captures how the supererogatory occupies a moral space well above that of the minimally decent or even the ordinary.Your second item here.  Supererogatory actions are outstanding, extra-ordinary, and exemplary in both moral and practical senses.</item>
<item>Urmsom, a moral philosopher, remarks how the supererogatory has been neglected (up to the mid-twentieth century) by moral philosophy, dominated as it was in the previous century by the debate between Utilitarianism and Deontology.</item>
<item>Two quotations from Urmson show this clearly: (1)<emphasis>“But it does seem that these facts have been neglected in their general, systematic accounts of morality. It is indeed easy to see that on some of the best-known theories there is no room for such facts”</emphasis> (Urmson, 1958, p. 206). (2)<emphasis>“[s]imple utilitarianism, Kantianism, and intuitionism, then, have no obvious theoretical niche for the saint and the hero”</emphasis> (Urmson, 1958: 207).</item>

<item>The difference is between that which is morally exemplary versus that which is just over the threshold of wrongdoing.</item>
<item><emphasis>"I suggest that moral minimums are best understood as negative standards, universally agreed upon “bottom lines” beyond which it is morally questionable to act. For example, it is almost always wrong to deliberately harm or contribute to harming another person or persons; to deliberately violate their rights to freedom, life, or property; to treat individuals or classes of individuals with disrespect; to compete or cooperate unfairly; not to honor promises or contract; or to be dishonest or deceitful. Whereas these moral minimums do not define goodness, fairness, or benefit, or define the positive content of rights, they set minimum guidelines for behavior that most people everywhere might agree on…."</emphasis> (Werhane, 1999: 122).</item>

<title>Moral Exemplars</title>
<list id="element-187" list-type="bulleted"><item>1. William LeMesseur.  LeMesseur designed the Citicorp Building in New York.  When  a student identified a critical design flaw in the building during a routine class exercise, LeMesseur responded, not by shooting the messenger, but by developing an intricate and effective plan for correcting the problem before it issued in drastic real world consequences.  Check out LeMesseur's profile at onlineethics and see how he turned a potential disaster into a good deed.</item>
	<item>2. Fred Cuny, starting in 1969 with Biafra, carried out a series of increasingly effective interventions in international disasters.  He brought effective methods to disaster relief such as engineering know-how, political savvy, good business sense, and aggressive advocacy.  His timely interventions saved thousands of Kurdish refugees in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War in 1991.  He also helped design and implement an innovative water filtration system in Sarajevo during the Bosnia-Serb conflict in 1993.  For more details, consult the biographical sketch at onlineethics.</item>
	<item>3. Roger Boisjoly worked on a team responsible for developing o-ring seals for fuel tanks used in the Challenger Shuttle.  When his team noticed evidence of gas leaks he made an emergency presentation before officials of Morton Thiokol and NASA recommending postponing the launch scheduled for the next day.  When decision makers refused to change the launch date, Boisjoly watched in horror the next day as the Challenger exploded seconds into its flight.  Find out about the courageous stand Boisjoly took in the aftermath of the Challenger explosion by reading the biographical sketch at onlineethics.</item>
	<item>4. Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2006.  His effort in setting up "micro-businesses" funded through "micro-lending" has completely changed the paradigm on how to extend business practices to individuals at the bottom of the pyramid.  Learn about his strategies for creating micro-businesses and how those strategies have been extended throughout the world, including Latin America, by listening to an interview with him broadcast by the Online News Hour.  (See link included in this module.)</item>
	<item>5. Bill Gates has often been portrayed as a villain, especially during the anti-trust suit against Mircosoft in the mid 1990's.  Certainly his aggressive and often ruthless business practices need to be evaluated openly and critically.  But recently Gates stopped participating in the day-to-day management of his company, Microsoft, and has set up a charitable foundation to oversee international good works projects.  Click on the link included in this module to listen to and read an interview recently conducted with him and his wife, Melinda, on their charitable efforts.</item>
	<item>6. Jeffrey Skilling, former CEO of Enron, can hardly be called a moral exemplar.  Yet when Enron was at its peak, its CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, was considered among the most innovative, creative, and brilliant of contemporary corporate CEOs.

<list id="element-611" list-type="bulleted"> 			

<item>Studies carried out by Chuck Huff into moral exemplars in computing suggest that moral exemplars can operate as craftspersons or reformers.  (Sometimes they can combine both these modes.)</item>
			
<item>Craftspersons (1) draw on pre-existing values in computing, (2) focus on users or customers who have needs, (3) take on the role of providers of a service/product, (4) view barriers as inert obstacles or puzzles to be solved, and (5) believe they are effective in their role.</item>

			<item>Reformers (1) attempt to change organizations and their values, (2) take on the role of moral crusaders, (3) view barriers as active opposition, and (4) believe in the necessity of systemic reform</item>
			
<item>These descriptions of moral exemplars have been taken from a presentation by Huff at the STS colloquium at the University of Virginia on October 2006.  Huff's presentation can be found at the link provided in the upper left hand corner of this module.</item>

<title>What Makes a Moral Exemplar?  PRIMES Explained</title>

<list id="element-994" list-type="bulleted"><title>General Comments on Exemplars</title><item>Moral exemplars have succeeded in integrating moral and professional attitudes and beliefs into their core identity.  Going against these considerations for moral exemplars is tantamount to acting against self.  Acting in accordance with them becomes second nature.</item>

<item>Moral exemplars often achieve their aims with the support of "support groups."  In fact, moral exemplars are often particularly adept at drawing support from surrounding individuals, groups and communities.  This goes against the notion that exemplars are isolated individuals who push against the current.  (Not all exemplars need fit as heroes into Ayn Rand novels.)  </item>

<item>Moral exemplars often do not go through periods of intensive and prolonged deliberation in order to hit upon the correct action.  If we want a literary example, we need to replace the tortured deliberations of a Hamlet with the quick and intuitive insight of an Esther Summerson.  (Summerson is a character in Charles Dickens' novel, Bleak House.  See both William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens for more examples of villains and exemplars.)  Some have situated moral exemplars within virtue ethics.  They have cultivated moral habits that allow them to do good as second nature.  They have also found ways to integrate moral reasoning with emotion (as motive), perception (which helps them zero in on moral relevance), and skill (which  helps implement moral value).  In this sense, moral expertise functions much as athletic or technical expertise; all are difficult to acquire but once acquired lead to highly skilled actions performed almost effortlessly.</item>

</list><para id="eip-271"><title>PRIMES</title>Primes stands for Personality, Integrating value into self-system, Moral Ecology, and Moral Skills Sets.  These are the elements composing moral expertise that have been identified by Huff and Rogerson based on interviews they conducted with exemplars in the areas of computing.</para><list id="eip-120"><title>Personality</title><item>Moral exemplars exhibit different configurations of personality traits based on the big five.  Locate the moral exemplar you have chosen in terms of the following five continuums (or continua):</item>
<item>Neuroticism to Lack of Neuroticism (Stability?)</item>
<item>Agreeableness to Disagreeableness</item>
<item>Extraversion to Introversion</item>
<item>Openness to Closedness</item>
<item>Conscientiousness to Lack of Conscientiousness</item>
<item>Examine your exemplar on each of these scales.  In and of themselves, these qualities are neither good nor bad.  They can be integrated to form bad characters or good characters.  In many cases, moral exemplars stand out through how they have put their personality characteristics to "good use."  (They have used them as vehicles or channels to excellence.)</item></list><list id="eip-237"><title>Integrating Moral Value into Self-System</title><item>As said above, moral exemplars stand out by the way in which (and the extent to which) they have integrated moral value into their self-system.  Because of this, they are strongly motivated to do good and avoid doing bad.  Both (doing good and refraining from doing bad) express who they are.  If they slip into bad deeds, this motivational system pushes them to improve to avoid repeating bad deeds.</item>
<item>One way of integrating moral value into self-system is by looking at stories and narratives of those who have displayed moral excellence.  Many of the individuals portrayed above (Carson, Boisjoly, LeMesseur, Cuny, Austin, and Yunus) provide concrete models of outstanding moral careers.</item>
<item>Literature also provides its models of moral exemplars.  Charles Dickens paints especially powerful portraits of both moral heroes (Esther Summerson and "Little Dorritt") and villains (Heep and Skimpole).</item>
<item>Other vehicles for integrating moral value centrally into the self-system lie in affiliations, relationships, and friendships.  Aristotle shows the importance of good friendships in developing virtues.  Moral exemplars most often can point to others who have served as mentors or strong positive influences.  For example, Roger Boisjoly tells of how he once went to a senior colleague for advice on whether to sign off on a design that was less than optimal.  His colleague's advice: would you be comfortable with your wife or child using a product based on this design?</item>
<item>The ethicist, Bernard Williams, has argued forcefully for the importance of personal projects in establishing and maintaining integrity.  Personal projects, roles, and life tasks all convey value; when these hold positive moral value and become central unifying factors in one's character, then they also serve to integrate moral value into the self system.</item>
<item>Augusto Blasi, a well known moral psychologist, gives a particularly powerful account (backed by research) of the integration of moral value into self-system and its motivational effect.</item>  </list><list id="eip-234"><title>Moral Ecology</title><item>Moral Ecologies: "The term moral ecology encourages us to consider the complex web of relationships and influences, the long persistence of some factors and the rapid evolution of others, the variations in strength and composition over time, the micro-ecologies that can exist within larger ones, and the multidirectional nature of causality in an ecology."  From Huff et. al.</item>
<item>Moral ecologies refer to social surrounds, that is, the different groups, organizations, and societies that surround us and to which we are continually responding.</item>
<item>We interact with these social surrounds as organisms interact with their surrounding ecosystems.  In fact, moral ecologies offer us roles (like ecological niches) and envelop us in complex organizational systems (the way ecosystems are composed of interacting and interrelated parts).  We inhabit and act within several moral ecologies; these moral ecologies, themselves, interact.  Finally, moral ecologies, like natural ecosystems, seek internal and external harmony and balance.  Internally, it is important to coordinate different the constituent individuals and the roles they play.  Externally, it is difficult but equally important to coordinate and balance the conflicting aims and activities of different moral ecologies.</item>
<item>Moral ecologies shape who we are and what we do.  This is not to say that they determine us.  But they do channel and constrain us.  For example, your parents have not determined who you are.  But much of what you do responds to how you have experienced them; you agree with them, refuse to question their authority, disagree with them, and rebel against them.  The range of possible responses is considerable but these are all shaped by what you experienced from your parents in the past.</item>
<item>The moral ecologies module (see the link provided above) describes three different moral ecologies that are important in business: quality-, customer-, and finance-driven companies.  (More "kinds" could be generated by combining these in different ways: for example, one could characterize a company as customer-driven but transforming into a quality-driven company.)  Roles, strategies for dissent, assessment of blame and praise, and other modes of conduct are shaped and constrained by the overall character of the moral ecology.</item>
<item>Moral ecologies, like selves, can also be characterized in terms of the "centrality" of moral value.  Some support the expression of moral value or certain kinds of moral value (like loyalty) while undermining or suppressing the expression of others (like courage or autonomy). </item>
<item>Finally, think in terms of how personality traits integrated around moral value interact with different types of moral ecology.  If a moral ecology undermines virtuous conduct, what strategies are available for changing it?  Or resisting it?  If there are different kinds of moral exemplar, which pair best with which moral ecology?  (How would a helper or craftsperson prevail in a finance-driven moral ecology like those characterized by Robert Jackall in <emphasis>Moral Mazes</emphasis>?</item> </list><list id="eip-100"><title>Moral Skills Sets</title><item>Moral expertise is not reducible to knowing what constitutes good conduct and doing your best to bring it about.  Realizing good conduct, being an effective moral agent, bringing value into the work, all require skills in addition to a "good will."  PRIMES studies have uncovered four skill sets that play a decisive role in the exercise of moral expertise.</item>
<item><emphasis>Moral Imagination</emphasis>:  The ability to project into the standpoint of others and view the situation at hand through their lenses.  Moral imagination achieves a balance between becoming lost in the perspectives of others and failing to leave one's own perspective.  Adam Smith terms this balance "proportionality" which we can achieve in empathy when we feel with them but do not become lost in their feelings. Empathy consists of feeling with others but limiting the intensity of that feeling to what is proper and proportionate for moral judgment.</item>
<item><emphasis>Moral Creativity</emphasis>: Moral Creativity is close to moral imagination and, in fact, overlaps with it.  But it centers in the ability to frame a situation in different ways.  Patricia Werhane draws attention to a lack of moral creativity in the Ford Pinto case.  Key Ford directors framed the problem with the gas tank from an economical perspective.  Had they considered other framings they might have appreciated the callousness of refusing to recall Pintos because the costs of doing so (and retrofitting the gas tanks) were greater than the benefits (saving lives).  They did not see the tragic implications of their comparison because they only looked at the economic aspects.  Multiple framings open up new perspectives that make possible the design of non-obvious solutions.</item>
<item><emphasis>Reasonableness</emphasis>: Reasonableness balances openness to the views of others (one listens and impartially weighs their arguments and evidence) with commitment to moral values and other important goals.  One is open but not to the extent of believing anything and failing to keep fundamental commitments.  The Ethics of Team Work module (see link above) discusses strategies for reaching consensus that are employed by those with the skill set of reasonableness.  These help avoid the pitfalls of group-based deliberation and action.</item>  
<item><emphasis>Perseverance</emphasis>: Finally, perseverance is the "ability to plan moral action and continue on that course by responding to circumstances and obstacles while keeping ethical goals intact." Huff et. al.</item>  </list>
</section><section id="eip-542"><title>Exercise: Two Portrayals of More and Cromwell</title><para id="eip-129">Watch the movie, <emphasis>A Man for All Seasons</emphasis>, which won the Oscar award for best picture in 1967.  Robert Bolt, who wrote both the play the movie was based on and much of the screen play sets out to portray More as a "hero of selfhood" (Preface to A Man for All Seasons, Xii).  As Bolt puts it: "<emphasis>Thomas More, as I wrote about him, became for me a man with an adamantine sense of own self.  He knew where he began and left off, what area of himself he could yield to the encroachments of his enemies, and what to the encroachments of those he loved. {B]ut at length he was asked to retreat from that final area where he located his self.  And there this supple, humorous, unassuming and sophisticated person set like metal, was overtaken by an absolutely primitive rigor, and could no more be budged than a cliff.</emphasis>"    </para><para id="eip-164">Bolt's characterization of More follows closely the model of authenticity set forth by the existentialists, especially Camus, as he states in the Preface to his play.  Here the human defines himself or herself through commitments undertaken.  These projects are incorporated into the self-system to form the core of one's personality.  Then integrity becomes the core value for the hero of selfhood.  Integrity is spelled out in terms of how one is able to resist external forces, challenges, and temptations to act against one's core beliefs and to break up the coherence of these self-defining beliefs.  More's challenge came in the form of an oath which required that he swear against his core beliefs and that he offer his own self as the guarantee of the truth of this oath.  Bolt goes to great lengths not to portray More as a religious fanatic.  More is portrayed as open, inquiring, questioning, and flexible in all areas except that core in terms of which he has defined his own self.  To go against this core would be to lose his very identity.</para><para id="eip-998">Thomas Cromwell is More's opponent in both Bolt's play, <emphasis>A Man for All Seasons</emphasis> and in Hilary Mantel's recent novels, <emphasis>Wolf Hall</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bring Out the Bodies</emphasis>.  But here is where the resemblance ends.  In Bolt's play, Cromwell is immoral and Machiavellian.  He takes his ends as already given; he accepts them as actionable and even moral without examination and without question.  Cromwell, in Bolt's play, restricts himself to figuring out the most effective and direct means to the ends handed down to him by his king (Henry VIII). Cromwell does not worry that his private conscience may be contrary to his public duties.  But More does, at least in Bolt's account.  In response to another "administrator," Cardinal Wolsey, More says the following: "<emphasis>Well...I believe, when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties...they lead their country by a short route to chaos"</emphasis> (MFAS 13).  One can get lost in the meandering of means and policies if one does not remain fixed and focused on moral ends.</para><para id="eip-302">Mantel's recent novels reverse the relations between More and Cromwell.  She writes explicitly and sympathetically from Cromwell's viewpoint adopting a style carefully crafted to transport the reader directly into Cromwell's perspective; the reader literally sees things through Cromwell's eyes.  Cromwell is portrayed as a humanist who is plagued by the problem of "dirty hands."  This is the supposedly realistic perception that in order to do good one must, in the complicated and imperfect world, do harm.  The Machiavellian calculation may be necessary if those intending good are to do good in this imperfect world.  Cromwell is aid and advisor to Henry VIII who is, in many ways, a tyrant.  Cromwell works to do Henry's will but also to blunt the force of its harmful consequences on others, especially the "common human."  (This is the ordinary human who, up to this point, has been left out of the scope of moral consideration.)  So Mantel portrays Cromwell as good but also as human and less than perfect; he does his best in a difficult and imperfect world.</para><para id="eip-310">Cromwell has not become Mantel's flawed moral exemplar because he softens Henry's harsh policies.  On the other hand, Thomas More, Bolt's hero, becomes a religious fanatic under Mantel's pen who refers to opponents in harsh, scatological language and who also tortures those whose religious views differ from his.  </para><para id="eip-893">There are obviously different interpretations of history at play in the different portrayals of Bolt and Mantel.  But more importantly, both seem to have different views of what is morally exemplary.  Bolt's More defines himself in terms of core beliefs and commitments and then remains true to these even in the face of overwhelming external challenge.  His claim to being a moral exemplar is based on his commitments and his giving up his life to remain true to these.  Mantel's Cromwell is a bit more complicated.  He is less committed to principle and more to compromise, to integrating differing and contending individuals and their positions, and to making the world a better place by gradually humanizing government and business.</para><table id="eip-12" summary="This table shows how Robert Bolt and Hilary Mantel provide radically different accounts of the conflict of More and Cromwell.

More's religious beliefs penetrate to his core self and arise out of a constellation of values, principles, and commitments that define his identity.

    <entry>Mantel provides an unflinching yet humanistic portrayal of Cromwell.  In order to do good in a corrupt political environment, Cromwell makes considerable concessions to expediency.  But his overall aim is to humanize England through the personal influence he exercises on its king and through the civilizing influence of international business.</entry>
    <entry>Bolt sees Cromwell as Machiavellian.  We see Cromwell through More's eyes as one who will sacrifice basic religious and moral truths for short-term political gain.  Cromwell will undertake a course of action with double effects if the good consequences outweigh the bad.  However, once Cromwell sacrifices principle and commitment, he loses his moral compass and sense of identity.</entry>
